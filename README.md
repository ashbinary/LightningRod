## Usage
LightningRod takes data from .nsp, .xci, and a direct romFS filesystem dump.

To use, first click on the button that says [Load Base .nsp/.xci File] or [Load romFS Directory].

This will allow you to start modifying the game using the options in the tool. After modifying the game, simply press [Load Game Data] and then [Randomize + Save]. When pressing [Randomize + Save], a request will pop up for a directory. This directory is the output directory for the tool, and will output the romFS files modified by the program.
